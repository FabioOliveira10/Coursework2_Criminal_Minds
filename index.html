        <h3>Top 1 - Masterpiece (S4E8)</b></h3> 
        <p>Jason Alexander turned in one of the most chilling and despicable villains in Criminal Minds history. He was Henry Grace, a narcissistic serial killer who believed he was born to be a master killer. Rossi captured his brother William, another serial killer, and this ruined Henry's life, which made Rossi someone he wanted to destroy and "Masterpiece" gave him the chance.</p>

        <h3><b>Top 2 - 100 (S5E9)</b></h3> 
        <p>The most demented, dangerous and hated villain in Criminal Minds history is easily The Reaper. Portrayed by C. Thomas Howell, had killed 20 people and was the unsub on the first ever case that Hotch worked as a BAU senior. No leads came, and The Reaper stopped killing. 11 years later, the lead investigator in the case called Hotch and said that he was dying and believed The Reaper would start killing again. It was true.</p>

        <h3><b>Top 3 - The Fisher King (S2E1)</b></h3> 
        <p>The Fisher King was a two-part case, the season finale of season 1 and the season premiere of season 2. The case surrounded a man named Randall Garner who was badly burned in a fire that took almost his entire family and ended up institutionalized at the same asylum that housed Reid's mother Diana. Despite his clear mental illness, he was released and set his sights on Reid and his partners in the BAU. </p>

        <h3><b>Top 4 - Revelations (S2E15))</b></h3> 
        <p>Spencer Reid is one of the most interesting characters on Criminal Minds, a brilliant young man who has trouble dealing with his own insecurities and whose own mother is institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia. Much of his neuroses are explored in "Revelations" in season 2 when he is captured by split personality serial killer Tobias Hankel. </p>
